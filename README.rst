~~~~~~~~~~
The project is currently undergoing major refactoring efforts towards version 0.3.4 (soon to be v0.4.0). This means that master branch might be broken from time to time in the nextcoming 2-3 weeks.

For now I suggest you use the latest stable release `v0.3.3 <https://github.com/cogu/autosar/releases/tag/v0.3.3>`_.

Prerequisites
-------------

- `Python 3.x <https://www.python.org/>`_
- `cfile <https://github.com/cogu/cfile/>`_

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is currently outdated and requires major update. You can see documentation for v0.3.3 `here <http://autosar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
